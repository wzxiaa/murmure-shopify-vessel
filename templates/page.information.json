At the heart of every one we make is a meticulous process of selection and refinement.<\/p><p>Only around 10% of raw cocoons meet our standards for use, hand-picked by teams who have worked with silk for decades. These artisans rely not on automation but on trained eyes and hands to assess the purity, length, and sheen of each strand.<\/p><p>The cocoons are steamed gently at low temperatures—not boiled or chemically treated—to preserve the protein structure and elasticity of the fibers. From there, the silk is hand-stretched into full sheets of continuous long-fiber layers, not short-fiber fillings or synthetic blends.<\/p><p>Up to 20 of these layers are stacked to create a single silk duvet—light, breathable, resilient, and beautifully even. The result isn’t just softness—it’s stability, structure, and a natural drape that adapts to the body.<\/p><p>Where many products focus on weight or appearance, we prioritize what you can’t see: the internal structure, the way each layer breathes, and how the fiber maintains its integrity over time.<\/p><p><strong>Sustainability, Woven In<\/strong><br\/>Silk is a naturally sustainable material—but we believe sustainability should be measured by action, not intention.<\/p><p>Our sericulture process incorporates pest monitoring systems to reduce reliance on chemicals, and we use environmental sensors to maintain balanced ecosystems inside our silkworm houses. We also work with small-scale local farmers to preserve traditional practices and minimize industrial disruption to biodiversity.<\/p><p>We extend this mindset throughout production: our dyes are non-toxic and certified safe; our packaging is recyclable and deliberately minimal; and our designs are made to last, not to be replaced.<\/p><p>We see sustainability not as a selling point, but as a quiet responsibility—a way of working that respects both people and planet.<\/p><p><strong>Softness Is Not Fragility—It’s a Choice<\/strong><br\/>In a world that moves quickly and often values the efficient over the thoughtful, silk might feel like an indulgence from another time.<\/p><p>But we believe there is strength in softness.<\/p><p>Each layer of silk we use is laid by hand. Every cocoon is assessed with care. There are no shortcuts in the process, because we’re not chasing speed—we’re chasing integrity.<\/p><p>Choosing silk isn’t about luxury for luxury’s sake. It’s about bringing something closer to the body that’s genuinely kind to it. It’s about surrounding ourselves with materials that last, and that support how we live—not just how we look.<\/p><p>To be soft is not to be weak. To be soft is to be deliberate. And sometimes, it’s the softest things that stay with us the longest.<\/p><p>A single thread may seem delicate.
